**_if life is a game so be fair play!_**

I was involved in a IVR application, since 2001, specifically a Telephone Banking center in which we produced voice stream to state customers' balance If you have a TTS (Text to speech) engine, everything would be simple: you select balance amount from the database as a float number and the engine will speak it out. The fact is not so wonderful, when we developed this program, there was no such Vietnamese TTS engine. Hence we have to do everything by hand, i.e. convert customer's balance to a textual representation, then produce voice stream from a series of pre-recorded voice files.
What's new in this version: Version 3.8 may include unspecified updates, enhancements, or bug fixes.
